A STREET BEGGAR CAN BE SEEN EVERYWHERE; AT THE BUS STOP, RAILWAY STATIONS, RELIGIOUS PLACES, MARKETS ETC. SOME BEGGARS ARE CRIPPLED, LAME AND SOME ARE BLIND. THEY ARE UNABLE TO EARN THEIR LIVELIHOOD. WHEREAS SOME ARE HEALTHY AND THEY DO NOT DESERVE OUR SYMPATHY. WE SHOULD SEE THAT THEY TAKE UP SOME PROFESSION. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BEG. ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL I SEE A BEGGAR DAILY. HE WEARS OLD RAGS. HE IS PARTIALLY BLIND. I FEEL PITY SEEING HIM BUT I CAN'T HELP IT I CAN ONLY PRAY TO GOD TO HELP HIM TO EARN HIS LIVELIHOOD.
THE DOCTOR IS A PERSON WHO LOOKS AFTER THE SICK PEOPLE AND PRESCRIBES MEDICINES SO THAT THE PATIENT RECOVERS FAST. IN ORDER TO BECOME A DOCTOR, A PERSON HAS TO STUDY MEDICINE. DOCTORS LEAD A HARD LIFE. THEIR LIFE IS VERY BUSY. THEY GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GO TO THE HOSPITAL. THEY WORK WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK. THEY ALWAYS REMAIN POLITE SO THAT PATIENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM. SINCE DOCTORS WORK SO HARD WE MUST KNOW THEIR VALUE.
A HAWKER IS A PERSON WHO MOVES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND SELL THEIR GOODS, BY SHOUTING ON THE STREETS. THEY WORK HARD THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THEY MOVE ON THE STREET ON THEIR BICYCLE AND SOMETIMES ON FOOT AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. WE CAN SEE HAWKERS EVERYWHERE. THEY MOVE EVERYWHERE SELLING THEIR GOODS WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE WEATHER. THERE IS A HAWKER WHO SELLS VEGETABLES ON HIS BICYCLE IN OUR LOCALITY. HE BRINGS FRESH VEGETABLES AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. HE IS A NICE AND AN HONEST HAWKER.
